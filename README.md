This is a Web application that lets users create an account, add school textbooks to their profile, and explore other users' textbooks to see if they might want to trade or purchase. This is my first time working with Ruby on Rails and Vue.js, so it is a pretty simple app to help me get a handle on the basics of these two new frameworks. I learned a lot about Rails routing, actions, and database, as well as Vue.js components and state management.
